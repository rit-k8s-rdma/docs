# Welcome to `rit-k8s-rdma` docs

This project aims to develop software components that allows the use of RDMA
from within containers managed by Kubernetes. It differs from the previous
projects it builds off of by allowing for more fine grained control over
various aspects of the system, including the ability to set bandwidth limits
and reserve bandwidth for specific Kubernetes pods.
